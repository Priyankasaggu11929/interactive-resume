"YOU: Hi, Alice! I'm looking for a competent, friendly, team oriented developer. Do you have someone to recommend? ALICE: mmm... Yeah! Do you know Timur? He's currently a frontend developer working for VSA partners at the IBM M&C lab in New York. Prior to moving to New York, he was with an engineering startup based in Sherbrooke, Quebec called Ingeniarts. He was responsible for implementing the communication between multiple microcontrollers via the CAN bus. These microcontrollers were all part of a distributed battery system prototype to be used in electrical vehicules and big electric lifts. That's right, Timur enjoys both high level and low level programming. He's a full stack engineer that loves finding out how things work, automating tasks and managing complexity to provide simple and clean solutions. YOU: Thank you Alice, that was informative. ALICE: No worries. You might want to talk to Isabelle for more details about his technical skills. She's the one working a few desks to my right. You can also download his resume in pdf format on the bottom of this page. YOU: Thanks, take care now! ALICE: Bye bye!"}
