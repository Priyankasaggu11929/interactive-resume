I know he's been doing a lot of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) lately though. You can see a list of his courses right here. ALICE: M101 MongoDB for developers, 10gen, The MongoDB Company - M102 MongoDB for DBAs, 10gen, The MongoDB Company - Introduction to Computer Science, Building a Search Engine, Udacity - Introduction to Databases, Class2go, Stanford University - Web Development, Building a Blog, Udacity - Html5 Game Development, Udacity - Data Analysis, Coursera, John Hopkins University. ALICE: Right now though, he's at Hacker School, a 3 month full-time school in New York to become a better programmer. He seems to like it a lot. YOU: Thank you Alice, that was informative. ALICE: No worries. You might want to talk to Isabelle for more details about his technical skills. She's the one working a few desks to my right. YOU: Thanks, take care now! ALICE: Bye bye!"}
