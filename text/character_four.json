"YOU: Hi Isabelle, Alice told me you could tell me more about Timur's technical skills. ISABELLE: Yeah, sure! From what I know, Timur's been programming mostly in Python and Javascript. I know he did a few projects in C as well. Right before going to Hacker School he was working on a project where he made two microcontrollers (TMS320F2812 - Texas Instruments) communicate with each other using the CAN bus. He's made a few web applications like a Blog, a Wiki, a Bit torrent client, a few websites for some of his friends and a few Html5 games in the canvas. He's toyed around with a few databases, both relational and NoSQL, and caching systems: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Google Datastore (Google App Engine), Neo4j and Memcached. He's pretty strong with database/model schema, knows his data structures and algorithms and has good frontend skills with frameworks such as Angular and D3. I'm sure there is a lot more to be said, but you can check out all of his projects on github. There's a link to his profile on the bottom of this page. YOU: I will definitely take a look later! ISABELLE: You better! Make sure you talk to Mimi before you leave, she can tell you about his work experience. She's the one with the purple dress walking from her desk to the storage compartments. YOU: Thanks Isabelle, I appreciate your help. ISABELLE: You're welcome.",
