"YOU: Hi Mimi, can you tell me more about Timur's work experience? MIMI: Sure, no problem! Timur used to work for this web agency in Montreal called Human Equation. He was a marketing analyst before he started to learn programming by himself. He discovered that he enjoyed coding so much that he decided to make a career change. So he quit his job and started his reorientation process. In the summer of 2013, 6 months into his reorientation, he was able to get a summer internship with a tech startup in Atlanta called TicketingBox. He was a frontend developer and worked mostly with CSS and a bit of javascript. Later on, right before going to Hacker School, he was contracted by a startup in Quebec called Ingeniarts that works on R&D projects involving electrical vehicules. He was mandated to establish communication between multiple microcontrollers as part of a distributed battery system. If you want more detailed information, you can always download his resume in pdf format. YOU: Will do! Thanks Mimi. MIMI: Take care!",
