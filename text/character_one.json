"YOU: Hi Mimi, can you tell me more about Timur's work experience? MIMI: Sure, no problem! Timur used to work for this web agency in Montreal called Human Equation. He was a marketing analyst before he started to learn programming by himself and decided that's what he wanted to do with his life. Thus, he quit his job and started his reorientation process. In the summer of 2013, 6 months into his reorientation, he was able to get a summer internship with a tech startup in Atlanta called TicketingBox. He was a frontend developer there and worked mostly with CSS and a bit of javascript. As you can see, he doesn't have that much experience yet, but he loves what he does and will be an excellent programmer really soon. It might be worth it to give him a shot and invest in him. He won't let you down. If you want more detailed information, you can always download his resume in pdf format. YOU: Will do! Thanks Mimi. MIMI: Take care!",
