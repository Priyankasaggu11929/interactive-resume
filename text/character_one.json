"YOU: Hi Mimi, can you tell me something cool that Timur has done in the past few months? MIMI: Sure, no problem! Timur initially left Montreal to go to New York because he wanted to join other programmers at Hacker School (www.hackerschool.com) who shared the desire to improve their craft. Hacker School is a 3 month retreat for programmers that want to improve their skills. It is completely free for accepted students and is a self-driven and self-directed environment. While he was there, Timur made some Html5 games with javascript's canvas, explored Angular, did data visualizations with D3, implemented various data structures and algorithms from scratch (A* path finding, dijkstra's algorithm, sha256, doubly linked list, stack, queue, heap, trees, graphs, etc.) and worked on a javascript interpreter. He told me that it was such a great experience to be surrounded by so many smart people who shared similar passions and the same intellectual curiosity. YOU: That's so cool! Thanks Mimi. MIMI: My pleasure! Take care!",
